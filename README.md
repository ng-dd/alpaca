## Alpaca - A Simple Shipping Solution ##
The  holidays are a great time to hang out with friends and spend time with family – it’s always better together! We couldn’t think of a better time to announce Check-It-Twice, a new way to send your list to Santa.

From the people that brought you Tickle-Me-Elmo, Lego Star Wars, and Tomgachi, comes a new way to send us your Christmas wish-list. Kids of all ages can register for an account, and add items to their Christmas list. It’s the fastest way to keep the conversation going with Santa without spamming the entire North Pole. 

We’re so grateful for your support. Thank you for another terrific year – we love building toys for all of you! Wishing you a wonderful 2018.

Merry Listing,

The Elves

This project uses the [MEAN stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)):
* [**M**ongoose.js](http://www.mongoosejs.com) ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)): database
* [**E**xpress.js](http://expressjs.com): backend framework
* [**A**ngular 2+](https://angular.io): frontend framework
* [**N**ode.js](https://nodejs.org): runtime environment

Other tools and technologies used:
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io): frontend scaffolding
* [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com): layout and styles
* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io): icons
* [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io): user authentication
* [Angular 2 JWT](https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt): JWT helper for Angular
* [Bcrypt.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js): password encryption

## How to Get Started ##
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
2. Install Angular CLI: `npm i -g @angular/cli`
3. From project root folder install all the dependencies: `npm i`

## Run
### Development mode
`npm run dev`: [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) execute MongoDB, Angular build, TypeScript compiler and Express server.

A window will automatically open at [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). Angular and Express files are being watched. Any change automatically creates a new bundle, restart Express server and reload your browser.

### Production mode
`npm run prod`: run the project with a production bundle and AOT compilation listening at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) . 
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
