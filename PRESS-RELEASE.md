## Alpaca - A Simple Shipping Solution ##
We’ve been working to develop a totally new type of simple shipping solution. We call it Alpaca!

Ever rushed home for a delivery, only to find it delayed?  Ever worried about a gift not arriving in time for the holidays? What if you could see all your orders across the web in one easy resource. That’s why we built Alpaca.

Alpaca automatically stores your package details for all your orders across on the web.

Whatever you buy, we'll find and import your shipping details for you, integrated seamlessly into a Google Chrome extension.

Alpaca connects directly to major shipping carriers to display your order status in real time on your user dashboard.

Alpaca will be available soon. 

Happy pac'in!
